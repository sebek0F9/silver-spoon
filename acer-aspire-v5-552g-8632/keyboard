even though this was a fail, I learned some things.
I became increasingly frustrated for some of the keys, working and not working.
not suprised, considering it's age.

taking apart the entire laptop, i had the keyboard. and I completely took that apart.
after some information about keyboard mapping of keys, and some multimeter testing, i learned that the traces were screwed. it was only in one 
or two areas where the trace cuts off, but enough to affect the function of about 10 keys. yes, the bios keys. sadface.

when i try something, i really go all in. 

this was a 20 dollar keyboard, but id rather fix something when i can. in this case, it might have not been worth the time, but what I ended up
understanding through a bunch of trial and error was the concept of conductive glue or paint. the best ingredients should include a combination
of GRAPHITE, REFINED CARBON, and A METAL. the metal should be....the most conductive and in powder form. 
These ingredients have to be in powder form, it cannot include any chunk, even ones invisible to the naked eye. It must be MACHINED, so that 
it becomes uniform when solidified. 

anyway, i was able to make GLUE have continuity, but not PAINT. the paint always had resistence which might indicate conductivity, but never got 
continuity. couldn't use it for the PCB membrane of an ultra thin laptop keyboard.
