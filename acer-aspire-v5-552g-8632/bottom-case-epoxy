would you think a piece of plastic cost over $100 dollars for a replacement....
yes. since this model was quickly discontinued for unknown reasons after its release, calling acer or another company that sold acer parts
showed expensive price tags for it's parts.

this showed me that epoxy is awesome. cracks are no more a problem, with JB COLD WELD @ 5000 PSI. wow. 3 bucks.
after 12 years this laptop is still going. it gets really hot though, even since purchasing it. i suspect it had to do with its demise.
