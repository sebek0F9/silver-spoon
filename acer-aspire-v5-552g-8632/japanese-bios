inside the bios
revision 2.0.7 (3.xx)

after losing function of the internal keyboard i had to start using an external, but the mapping for bios functions do not work.
fn + esc doesn't yeild bios flash.
fn + esc 3 times does not reveal the advanced menu like it used to. 
thankfully i can still f2 for the bios itself, and f12 for boot order.
the company briefly opensourced their tools for legacy versions, which was probably mine (2012).
segfaults sometimes occur in the gui, in specific areas, so it's been somewhat frustrating. i can more or less navigate.
there are different versions of the tool, which work for some things and others.

another tool named phoenix seems promising.

using a pomona clip and a raspberry pi, i was able to dump the image via SPI, and reflash, but I still seem to get the default for some options
I changed.


Work in progress for a fully unlocked bios of this.
