I have completely gutted this dinosaur laptop. 
  the lcd screen was replaced, twice.
  ram is at max (12gb)
  internal keyboard is broken, had to take out
  cpu/gpu fan + heatsink was changed
  thermal grease replaced a few times
  hard drive replaced 2-3 times
  bios entries changed several times
  dozens of operating system installations
  motherboard replaced
  
 it still works! 10 years later. well, of course it does. its not the same anymore, literally. 
 i have new hardware now, but it sure helped the frugal days. i had a hard time letting it go, still do. 
 i use it for non-work stuff.
