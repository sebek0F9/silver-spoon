Many thanks to the samples I received from: Microchip, NXP, Maxim/Analog Devices, Silicon Labs.
Non-production project.

Assembling from scratch. 
  Designing PCB layout in KiCAD for factory print using gerbers
  ARM and ARM-based microprocessors with cryptographic co processors
  Supersingular Isogeny and/or Lattice-based encryption is a must
  Preferably Edwards Curves.
  
Will be comparing several microcontrollers for implementing post-quantum security.
inspired by projects like NitroKey, GNUK authentication.
Inspired by NIST-P vulnerabilities being discovered
Inspired by the Insurgo PrivacyBeast x230
